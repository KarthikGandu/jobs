* Review code and get your code reviewed, mentor and be mentored by other engineers
* Design and build solutions to improve the reliability and resilience of our services
* Write, review, or provide feedback on a technical design proposal
* Have an operational responsibility in addition to being a software developer. You will participate in the team's on-call rotation, assist with triaging and addressing production issues, and respond to incidents.

**What you should have:**
-------------------------

* A bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or a related field/ equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience.
* Experience building large-scale systems professionally for 4+ years and can point to things you’ve worked on.
* Experience managing critical production infrastructure, maintaining reliability and uptime, and having a customer first view of operational safety.
* Experience with reliable, safe distributed systems and an understanding of engineering and product trade-offs, and how to make a case for either.
* Experience with working on complex issues where the analysis requires an in-depth knowledge of the company and existing architecture.
* Experience with writing unit tests, code review, design documentation, debugging, and troubleshooting. You've been developing and operating web applications professionally and can talk at length to things you and your teams have built
* A curious, inquisitive, and determined mindset to fix things when they break.
* US Citizen or Green Card holder

**Bonus points**
----------------

* Experience with the Go programming language

* Experience with AWS
* Experience building and releasing software using Docker containers
