AWS EC2 owns the design, planning, delivery, and operation of all AWS server instances. In other words, we’re the people who keep the cloud running. We support all AWS compute, storage, accelerator servers and ensure our customers have continual access to the innovation they rely on. We work on the most challenging problems, with thousands of variables impacting the supply chain — and we’re looking for talented people who want to help.  
  
You’ll join a diverse team of hardware engineers, software engineers, system engineers, technical program managers, and other vital roles. You’ll collaborate with people across AWS to help us deliver the highest standards for safety and security while providing seemingly infinite capacity at the lowest possible cost for our customers. And you’ll experience an inclusive culture that welcomes bold ideas and empowers you to own them to completion.  
  
Key job responsibilities  
AWS hardware Engineering is looking for a customer-obsessed, team-driven technology leader to take our engineering of server hardware and software to the next level. As a cloud server performance engineer, you’ll work on Amazon’s hardest problems, building high quality, architecturally sound systems that meet or exceed the high performance bar, with focus on high speed interconnects, including PCIe. You will interact with internal and external interdisciplinary teams of engineers to design, develop, validate, launch, monitor and troubleshoot high throughput interfaces at scale. You will be on the team that is responsible for PCIe topology for the EC2 servers, including retimer and switch firmware and telemetry. This is a fast-paced, intellectually challenging position. At AWS we are changing the industry and want individuals who are ready for a challenge to reach beyond what is possible today.

\*Inclusive Team Culture\*  
Here at AWS, it’s in our nature to learn and be curious. Our employee-led affinity groups foster a culture of inclusion that empower us to be proud of our differences.
