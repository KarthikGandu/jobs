SEON is the command center for fraud prevention and AML compliance, helping thousands of companies worldwide stop fraud, reduce risk and protect revenue. Powered by 900+ real-time, first-party data signals, SEON enriches customer profiles, flags suspicious behavior and streamlines compliance workflows - all from one place. SEON provides richer data, more flexible and transparent analysis, and faster time to value than any other provider on the market. We’ve helped companies reduce fraud by 95% and achieve 32x ROI, and we’re growing fast, thanks to our partnerships with some of the world’s most ambitious digital brands like Revolut, Wise, and Bilt.

We are looking for a Senior Platform Engineer to join the team responsible for building the core engine of our technical velocity. Unlike a traditional SRE role focused on operating production systems, your mission is to build the self-service tooling that empowers our product engineers to ship code securely, rapidly, and autonomously.

You will work closely with the Senior Manager of Platform Engineering to treat our infrastructure as a product and our developers as customers. You will architect the ""Golden Paths"" that remove friction, reduce cognitive load, and enable our teams to scale in lockstep with our rapid business growth.

This role offers **flexibility** and can be based preferably in Budapest, Hungary in a hybrid setting or anywhere in **the EU** with a **remote** setup, including occasional travel to our other offices.

**WHAT YOU’LL DO:**

* Golden Path Architecture: Design and implement the ""Golden Paths""—standardized, automated templates for microservices and infrastructure that allow developers to deploy safely and quickly without needing deep infrastructure expertise.
* Self-Service Tooling: Develop the CLI tools, portals, or API interfaces that abstract the complexity of our cloud infrastructure, allowing developers to self-serve resources.
* Infrastructure as Software: Develop and maintain a library of modular, testable, and versioned Terraform modules that serve as the building blocks for all engineering teams.
* CI/CD Orchestration: Architect robust, reusable GitHub Actions workflows and GitOps pipelines (e.g., ArgoCD) that automate the entire delivery lifecycle, enforcing quality gates automatically.
* Automated Governance: Implement ""Compliance by Design"" using tools like Open Policy Agent (OPA) to automate security and compliance controls (e.g., SOC2, ISO) directly into the delivery pipeline.
* Observability Vending: Working closely with SRE, ensure that every service deployed via the Golden Path automatically inherits standard logging, metrics (Prometheus), and dashboards (Grafana) without manual configuration.

**WHAT YOU’ll BRING:**

* **Platform & DevOps Mastery:** 5+ years of experience in Platform Engineering, DevOps, or Site Reliability Engineering, with a demonstrable track record of building infrastructure and tools for other engineers.
* **Software Engineering Fluency:** Unlike traditional ops roles, this position requires strong coding skills. You are proficient in a high-level language (e.g., **Go, Python**) and use it to build automation, CLIs, or platform plugins.
* **Cloud Native Expertise:** Deep, hands-on mastery of **AWS** and **Kubernetes**. You understand how to extend Kubernetes (e.g., Operators, CRDs) to simplify developer workflows.
* **IaC at Scale:** Expert-level knowledge of **Terraform**. You don't just write state files; you design reusable module hierarchies and manage remote state strategies.
* **Strategic Vision:** You understand the balance between standardization (governance) and developer autonomy (innovation), and can design systems that support both.
* **Security Mindset:** Experience working in regulated environments (FinTech preferred). You understand **DevSecOps** and how to automate compliance checks (SAST/DAST) within the pipeline.
* **Empathy & Communication:** You possess excellent communication skills and a ""customer-first"" attitude, capable of bridging the gap between complex infrastructure and application development.
