We are looking for a Software Development Engineer to help build and scale the infrastructure powering Amazon’s next-generation agentic advertiser guidance framework. In this role, you will design and implement core components of the agent execution engine, evaluation pipelines, and model tuning infrastructure that enable agents to reason, plan, and act across complex advertiser workflows. You will work closely with senior engineers and applied scientists to translate research prototypes into robust, high-performance production systems. You will need to dive deep into new technologies—such as LLM deployment frameworks, reinforcement learning infrastructure, and multi-step reasoning orchestration—and quickly apply them to solve real customer problems. You will own well-defined but often ambiguous technical problems, ensuring your solutions are scalable, reliable, and directly contribute to advertiser-facing products. This role is highly impactful: your contributions will form the backbone of the systems that deliver personalized, context-aware guidance to millions of advertisers. You will collaborate across science, product, and platform teams, and your work will focus on building resilient, observable, and maintainable systems that accelerate innovation in agent-based AI.  
  
Key job responsibilities  

* Implement core services and APIs for agent orchestration, tool invocation, and state management.
* Build scalable, reusable data and tool registry
* Build components of evaluation pipelines (offline/online) for measuring reasoning quality, advertiser outcomes, and safety guardrails.
* Develop infrastructure to support fine-tuning and reinforcement learning pipelines, collaborating with scientists to productionize workflows.
* Ensure performance, scalability, observability, and maintainability through strong engineering practices.
* Participate in system design, code reviews, and team architecture discussions.
* Continuously learn and apply new techniques in agentic frameworks, distributed systems, and cloud-native development.

The Advertiser Guidance team within Sponsored Products and Brands is focused on guiding and supporting 1.6MM advertisers to meet their advertising needs of creating and managing ad campaigns.

Our vision is to build a highly personalized, context-aware agentic advertiser guidance system that leverages LLMs together with tools such as auction simulations, ML models, and optimization algorithms. This agentic framework, will operate across both chat and non-chat experiences in the ad console, scaling to natural language queries as well as proactively delivering guidance based on deep understanding of the advertiser. To execute this vision, we collaborate closely with stakeholders across Ad Console, Sales, and Marketing to identify opportunities—from high-level product guidance down to granular keyword recommendations—and deliver them through a tailored, personalized experience. Our work is grounded in state-of-the-art agent architectures, tool integration, reasoning frameworks, and model customization approaches (including tuning, MCP, and preference optimization), ensuring our systems are both scalable and adaptive.
